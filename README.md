# Content-dependent-block-adaptive-image-contrast-enhancement-algorithm

Extract local features and enhance image contrast adaptively.


Attention:

The algorithm can be used for medical image enhancement, but it needs to be optimized. When the distribution of the histogram of the image block fluctuates abnormally,
the images' color will be biased.
